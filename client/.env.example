# ProJectra Client â€“ Vite Environment (copy to client/.env.local)

# By default the frontend uses '/api' and Vite proxy to reach the backend at http://localhost:4000 in dev.
# If you deploy the client separately from the server, set a full URL, e.g.:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com/api

VITE_API_URL=/api
